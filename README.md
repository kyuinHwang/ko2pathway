# Metabolic Potential Inference Pipeline Using KEGG KO Annotations

This pipeline analyzes KO annotations of draft microbial genomes (e.g., SAGs, MAGs) to infer their potential metabolic functions.

It uses KEGG Orthologs (KOs) assigned to each genome to evaluate the presence of important metabolic pathways and enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The analysis includes two complementary tracks:

(1) multi-step KEGG modules to assess complex pathways (e.g., Glycolysis, TCA cycle), and

(2) single or few-KO reactions for identifying simple but functionally important processes.

The pipeline is tolerant of genome incompleteness or annotation error by allowing partial pathway coverage; for example, complex pathways are considered present if a majority of steps and key functional steps are detected.

The pipeline is designed to work with minimal input (KO annotation files) and can be extended with additional evidence if available (e.g., BLAST results, FeGenie outputs).


## Installation
This pipeline requires Python 3.10 or higher.
No additional Python packages are strictly required, as the pipeline mainly uses standard libraries and subprocess calls.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyuinHwang/ko2pathway.git
cd ko2pathway
```

Cloning the repository and setting up the pipeline takes only a few seconds on a standard system.

## System Requirements & Notes

**Tested on:** Ubuntu 24.04 (Docker container on macOS) with Python 3.12.7 and standard library only.

**System requirements:** No special hardware is required. The pipeline runs on a standard laptop environment

## Usage

Run the entire pipeline:
``` bash
python run_pipeline.py --ko_dir ./examples --module_file /kegg/module/module.gz --keyenzyme_dir ./KeyEnzymes --output_dir ./output
```

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Make sure the --module_file argument points to the correct location of your KEGG module file.

Or run each script individually for modular control:

## Scripts
1_track_steps.py: Checks KO presence for each step in KEGG modules.

2_evaluate_modules.py: Determines whether each module is likely functional, based on majority step coverage (>=0.5) and key step presence.

3_check_reactions.py: Detects simple reactions based on presence of relevant KO(s).

## Input
ko_dir : Directory including KO annotations of queried genomes (Genome.ko files). Genome.ko is a tab-delimited file listing each gene's locus tag and its corresponding KO assignment, one per line (e.g., EXCAFAC_00031 K00302). This file can be generated through BLAST searches as described in our publication (see Reference section below), or via the [KEGG annotation web server](https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/annotation/)

module_file : A file containing the definitions of KEGG modules. This can be downloaded from the KEGG FTP server (module/module.gz) by users with a valid KEGG subscription.


## Files
./KeyEnzymes/:
This directory contains files listing the KOs responsible for simple metabolic reactions. In contrast, the complex pathways of interest (based on KEGG modules) are defined within 1_track_steps.py, and the threshold conditions (e.g., minimum step coverage, key steps) are specified in 2_evaluate_modules.py.

> **Note on KEGG Version:**
> The selection of KOs, key-steps and threshold were curated based on KEGG release from October 23, 2019. Since the module definition and participating KOs may have changed, users working with a different KEGG version should manually verify :
> (1) the list of target module IDs in 1_track_steps.py, (2) threshold and key steps defined in 2_evalulate_modules.py, and (3) the KO lists in files under ./KeyEnzymes

./examples/:
Contains KO profiles of three public genomes belonging to the genus g__SURF-13.

./extended_examples/:
This directory provides example input files used in our full research pipeline, which integrates additional sources of evidence (e.g., FeGenie results, BLAST hits) that are not handled by the core scripts in this repository. These files were used in the published study but are not part of the reproducible module.  
Users who wish to extend the pipeline with such additional data sources may refer to the example scripts provided in this directory as a starting point for further customization. 
Notably, the presence of form I coxL was manually determined based on a phylogenetic tree and is not part of either the core scripts or the extended example files.



## Output
By default (with run_pipeline.py), the results are summarized into two tab-delimited tables:

./OUTPUT_DIR/Pathway.txt: Summarizes the presence (Y) or absence (N) of complex pathways (based on KEGG modules) for each genome.

./OUTPUT_DIR/Reactions.txt: Summarizes the presence (Y) or absence (N) of simple reactions for each genome.
Each row corresponds to a genome, and each column to a specific pathway or reaction.
